Problem 1 and 2 are written by Matlab, yet problem 3 and 4 are written by Python in Jupyter Notebook, where numpy is required. 
The codes and parameters are illustrate elaborately in the report. Hence they will not be explained separately in each folder. However, necessary information, such as input and output, is still contained in program annotations.

NOTE: These codes alone cannot depict the graphs in the report. Some additional short commands are contained in the report.
